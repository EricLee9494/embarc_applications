# How to Contribute to embARC Applications

embARC users are welcome to make contributions to embARC, including examples, source code (bug fixes and/or new packages), and documentation. This document is intended to help you contribute to embARC Applications quickly.

## Prerequisites

The hardware we used during development is **EM Starter Kit(aka EMSK)**. We need to download and install the following tools:

+ Download and install [**Development Tools**][30].

	+ Here we use [GNU Toolchain][31] in **windows** host.
	+ For using GNU or other tools in different host, see [Getting Started with embARC OSP][32] for reference.

	![gnu_make][0]

+ Download and install [**Digilent Adapt Software**][33], driver for Digilent JTAG-USB cable.

	![digilent_adapt][1]

+ Download and install [**Zadig**][34], replacing a driver for **Windows** host.
	+ Before you can start using OpenOCD, you have to download WinUSB driver and replace with it one of FTDI drivers for your hardware development system.
	+ See [How to Use OpenOCD on Windows][35] for reference.
	+ For more information, see [ARC GNU Toolchain Wiki Home][36].

	![zadig][2]

	Notices: To do that, you have to connect EMSK to PC using JTAG-USB cable. Then click on the *Options* - *List all devices*, and you can find **Digilent USB Device(Interface 0/1)**. Just replacing **Digilent USB Device(Interface 0)** to WinUSB driver, it helps PC to load executable file into EMSK.

	You can see **Digilent USB Device** in the Device Manager if the driver has been installed successfully.

	![device_manager][3]

+ Get [**embARC OSP**][37] and [**embARC Applications**][38] source code.
	+ Get a [Github Account][39]. Download and install [Git][40]，and you have to learn how to develop projects using git. See [Git Book][41] for reference.
	+ Download the [**embARC OSP**][37] and rename it to *embarc\_osp*.
	+ Fork the *embarc\_applications* to your own repo. You will develop the project based on that in your host.

	![fork_app_repo][4]

	+ Goto the folder `./embarc_osp`. Run the **Git Bash** and type the following commands to clone **embARC Applications** source code to `./embarc_osp/application` folder:

		    cd embarc_osp
			git clone https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/embarc_applications.git application

	Then, you can see there are serval applications existing in this folder, such as *aws\_iot\_smarthome*, *aws\_iot\_smarthome\_multinode*, etc.

	+ See [embARC Applications README][42] for reference.

+ Download and install [**Doxygen**][43] for building embARC document.

	Goto the path: `./embarc_osp/doc`, run the **Command Line** and use the following commands to make embARC document.

	![document_folder][5]

	![doxygen_make][6]

	A few minutes later, you can open the *embARC\_Document.html* using browser.

	![embarc_document][7]

+ Download and install [**Tera Term**][44].

## Getting Start with Existing Application

We provided some examples and applications in embARC, user can take reference from them.

+ Access to the examples: [source code of embARC examples][45]
+ Access to the applications: [source code of embARC applications][38]

Here we take bootload example using GNU and EMSK 2.2, EM11D for example. Goto the path: `.\embarc_osp\example\baremetal\bootloader`, run the Command Line and type commands for building and running.

![cmd_make][8]

Run the Tera Term:

![tera_term][9]

For more detail information, see [Getting Started with embARC Using GNU on Windows][46] for reference. And see [Getting Started with embARC OSP][47] to learn how to get start with embARC using different toolsets or hosts.

## Creating a New Application in embARC

See the document **Example Usage Guide** - `./embarc_osp/doc/embARC_Document/html/page_example_usage.html` in the *embarc\_osp* for more detail information. It will help you to create a **Hello World** application using ARC GNU quickly.

![example_usage_guide][10]

## Developing Your Application Using Git

1) Make sure you have installed [Git][40]，and know how to use it.

2) Goto the folder `./embarc_osp/application`, create a new folder for your own application, like **smart_device**. Please notice that your application projects should be placed under the folder `./embarc_osp/application`, not `./embarc_osp/example`.

3) Copy **example.makefile** and **main.c.tmpl** in `./embarc_osp/example` folder to the newly created **smart_device** folder.

+ Rename example.makefile to **makefile**.
+ Rename main.c.tmpl to **main.c.**
+ Change the configurations in makefile according to your hardware configuration.
+ Modify your main.c.
+ Compile this application on the command line.
+ Run or debug this application.

   See the document **Example Usage Guide** in the *embarc\_osp* for more information.

Notices:

+ All C source code must adhere to [**Linux Kernel Coding Style**][48]. The source-code files in embARC are documented with C-style code comments and Doxygen-based comments. A Doxygen comment example is shown below:

}

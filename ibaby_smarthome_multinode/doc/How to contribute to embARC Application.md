#How to Contribute to embARC Applications#

embARC users are welcome to make contributions to embARC, including examples, source code (bug fixes and/or new packages), and documentation. This document is intended to help you contribute to embARC Applications quickly.

##Prerequisites##

The hardware we used in the development is EM Start Kit. We need to download and install the following tools: 

+ Download and install [**Development Tools**](http://embarc.org/tools.html "IDE"). 
	+ Here we use [GNU Toolchain](https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/toolchain/releases "GNU Toolchain") in **windows** host.
	+ For using GNU or other tools in different host, see [Getting Started with embARC OSP](https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/embarc_osp/wiki/Getting-Started-with-embARC-OSP "Getting Started with embARC OSP") for reference.
	
	![GNU-make](http://i.imgur.com/wcpgoKn.png)

+ Download and install [**Digilent Adapt Software**](http://store.digilentinc.com/digilent-adept-2-download-only/ "Digilent Adapt Software"), driver for Digilent JTAG-USB cable.

+ Download and install [**zadig**](http://zadig.akeo.ie/ "zadig"), replacing a driver for **windows** host.
	+ Before you can start using OpenOCD, you have to download WinUSB driver and replace with it one of FTDI drivers for your hardware development system.
	+ See [How to Use OpenOCD on Windows](https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/arc_gnu_eclipse/wiki/How-to-Use-OpenOCD-on-Windows "How to Use OpenOCD on Windows") for reference.
	+ For more information, see [toolchain Home](https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/toolchain/wiki "Home").

	Notices: To do that, you have to connect EMSK to PC using JTAG-USB cable. Then click on the "Options" - "List all devices", and you can find **Digilent USB Device(Interface 0/1)**. Just replacing one to WinUSB driver, it helps PC to load executable file into EMSK, and you can choose Interface 0/1.

	Make sure the driver has been install successfully, see **Diligent USB Device** in the Device Manager.

+ Download [**embARC OSP**](https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/embarc_osp "embARC Software") and [**embARC Applications**](https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/embarc_applications "embARC Applications").
	+ It's better to get a [Github Account](https://github.com/ "Github account"), and fork the *embarc\_applications* to your own repository. Then develop the project based on that in your host.
	+ Placing the **embarc\_applications** under the folder **./embarc\_osp**, Rename it to applications.

+ Download and install [**Doxygen**](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html "Doxygen") for building embARC document.

	Goto the path: ./embarc\_osp/doc, run the **Command Line** and use the following command to make embARC document.

	A few minutes later, you can open the *embARC\_Document.html* using browser.

+ Download and install [**Tera Term**](https://zh.osdn.net/projects/ttssh2/ "Tera Term")..

##Getting Start with existing Application##

We provided some examples and applications in embARC, user can take reference from them.

+ Access to the examples: [source code of embARC examples](https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/embarc_osp/tree/master/example "examples")
+ Access to the applications: [source code of embARC applications](https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/embarc_applications "applications")

Here we use EMSK 2.2, EM11D for example. Goto the path: .\embarc_osp\example\baremetal\bootloader, run the Command Line and type commands for building and running.

For more detail information, see [Getting Started with embARC Using GNU on Windows](https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/embarc_osp/wiki/Getting-Started-with-embARC-Using-GNU-on-Windows#building-and-running-your-first-example "Getting Started with embARC Using GNU on Windows") for reference. And see [Getting Started with embARC OSP](https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/embarc_osp/wiki/Getting-Started-with-embARC-OSP "Getting Started with embARC OSP") to learn how to get start with embARC using different toolsets or hosts.

##Creating a New Application in embARC##

See the document **Example Usage Guide** - *./embarc\_osp/doc/embARC\_Document/html/page\_example\_usage.html* in the *embarc\_osp* for more detail information. It will help you to create a **"Hello World"** application using ARC GNU quickly.

##Developing Your Application Using Git##

We recommand you to develop the application following these steps:

1) Download and install [Git](https://git-for-windows.github.io/ "Git")ï¼Œand learning how to develop projects using git. See [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 "Git Book") for reference.

2) You have *embarc\_osp*, then goto the folder *./embarc\_osp* and create a new folder named "applications". Running the **Git Bash** and type:

		$ git init
		$ git remote add origin [url of your embarc\_applications repository]
		$ git pull origin master

   Then, you can see there are serval applications existing in this folder, such as *aws_iot_smarthome*, *aws_iot_smarthome_multinode*, etc.

3) Create a new folder for your own application, named **helloworld**.

4) Copy **example.makefile** and **main.c.tmpl** in *./embarc\_osp/example* folder to the newly created helloworld folder.

+ Rename example.makefile to **makefile**.
+ Rename main.c.tmpl to **main.c.**
+ Change the configurations in makefile according to your hardware configuration.
+ Modify your main.c.
+ Compile this application on the command line.
+ Run or debug this application.

   See the document **Example Usage Guide** in the *embarc\_osp* for more information.
